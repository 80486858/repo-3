# Server

[![GoDoc](https://img.shields.io/badge/go.dev-reference-007d9c?logo=go&logoColor=white&style=shield)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go/server?tab=overview)

The Server package reduces the work required to write your own Rosetta server.
In short, this package takes care of the basics (boilerplate server code
and request validation) so that you can focus on code that is unique to your
implementation.

## Installation

```shell
go get github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go/server
```

## Examples
Check out the [examples](/examples/README.md) to see how easy
it is to create your own server.
