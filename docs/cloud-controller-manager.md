# Cloud controller manager for Azure

`azure-cloud-controller-manager` is a Kubernetes component that provides interoperability with Azure API, and will be used by Kubernetes clusters running on Azure. It runs together with other components to provide the Kubernetes clusterâ€™s control plane.

Using [cloud-controller-manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#cloud-controller-manager) is a new alpha feature for Kubernetes since v1.6. `cloud-controller-manager` runs cloud provider related controller loops, which used to be run by `controller-manager`.

`azure-cloud-controller-manager` is a specialization of `cloud-controller-manager`. It depends on [cloud-controller-manager app](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cmd/cloud-controller-manager/app) and [azure cloud provider](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/cloudprovider/providers/azure).

## Usage
You can use [acs-engine](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine) to deploy a Kubernetes cluster running with cloud-controller-manager. It supports deploying `Kubernetes azure-cloud-controller-manager` for Kubernetes v1.8+.
