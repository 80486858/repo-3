Uses `unsafe` blocks to interact with `windows-sys` crate.
- `SHGetKnownFolderPath` safety requirements are met.
- `CoTaskMemFree` has no effect if passed `NULL`, so there is no issue if some
  future refactor created a pathway where `ffi::Guard` could be dropped before
  `SHGetKnownFolderPath` is called.
- Small nit: `ffi::Guard::as_pwstr` takes `&self` but returns `PWSTR` which is
  the mutable type; it should instead return `PCWSTR` which is the const type
  (and what `lstrlenW` takes) instead of implicitly const-casting the pointer,
  as this would better reflect the intent to take an immutable reference.
- The slice constructed from the `PWSTR` correctly goes out of scope before
  `guard` is dropped.
- A code comment says that `path_ptr` is valid for `len` bytes, but `PCWSTR` is
  a `*const u16` and `lstrlenW` returns its length \"in characters\" (which the
  Windows documentation confirms means the number of `WCHAR` values). This is
  likely a typo; the code checks that `len * size_of::<u16>() <= isize::MAX`.
