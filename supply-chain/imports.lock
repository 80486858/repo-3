Uses `unsafe` blocks to interact with `windows-sys` crate.
- `SHGetKnownFolderPath` safety requirements are met.
- `CoTaskMemFree` has no effect if passed `NULL`, so there is no issue if some
  future refactor created a pathway where `ffi::Guard` could be dropped before
  `SHGetKnownFolderPath` is called.
- Small nit: `ffi::Guard::as_pwstr` takes `&self` but returns `PWSTR` which is
  the mutable type; it should instead return `PCWSTR` which is the const type
  (and what `lstrlenW` takes) instead of implicitly const-casting the pointer,
  as this would better reflect the intent to take an immutable reference.
- The slice constructed from the `PWSTR` correctly goes out of scope before
  `guard` is dropped.
- A code comment says that `path_ptr` is valid for `len` bytes, but `PCWSTR` is
  a `*const u16` and `lstrlenW` returns its length \"in characters\" (which the
  Windows documentation confirms means the number of `WCHAR` values). This is
  likely a typo; the code checks that `len * size_of::<u16>() <= isize::MAX`.

This crate is a thin wrapper around the `reddsa` crate, which I did not review. I also
did not review tests or verify test vectors.

The comment on `batch::Verifier::verify` has an error in the batch verification equation,
filed as https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/redjubjub/issues/163 . It does not affect the
implementation which just delegates to `reddsa`. `reddsa` has the same comment bug filed as
https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/reddsa/issues/52 , but its batch verification implementation
is correct. (I checked the latter against https://zips.z.cash/protocol/protocol.pdf#reddsabatchvalidate
